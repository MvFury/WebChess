Table based HTML design, chess pieces as objects;

Planning to create simple AI(Is it even called these days like that?) in stages;
  
☐ Simply abiding by the game rules at first, just moving the game pieces blindly;
  
☐ Then the AI gets more intuitive - meaning thinking one move ahead. Won't walk to the square if it can see that my (player's) piece can attack that;
  
☐ Then we add more obervation for comming moves (lot of cluster fuck, lots of IF's, planning on doing a algorithm map), thinking the golden center would be three moves ahead;

☐ Lastly (would be great if I even make it to this stage) adding the ability for AI to grasp the concept of game phases (early, mid, end game) for it to plan his moves accordingly;

The main point for this, is hoping that coding a robot to understand chess would help me understand chess more. Also it would give me practice;
